So iJailbreak could be confusing for most people.

.jos files or also known as Jail Operating System are the os files (MacOS, Android, iOS etc.) a few verified and recommended .jos files could be found on the github repositry.
.japp files are the most confusing ones. They look useless but they are custom modified apps (no illegal modifications)
josdriver.zip is the old software used in earlier versions used for opening the .jos files. Now it won't work. You can try using it but it will beep a few times which means an error while loading.
The josdriver app was only for Macs and the 1.0 and earlier versions swiched to Html code so it can be used on almost any devices.
